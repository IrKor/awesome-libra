## Current Problems

Regulators in countries where there are no clear rules for working with cryptocurrencies can stand on the way of launching Libra. In may 2019, the USA Senate Banking Committee wrote an open letter to Facebook, demanding to disclose the details of the project. Senators are interested in how the company will process users' personal data.

Also, Facebook representatives are negotiating with the commodity futures trading Commission to determine whether the cryptocurrency falls under jurisdiction. Also, late in the evening on the 18th of June 2019, the USA authorities asked Facebook to stop the development of the Libra cryptocurrency.

Moreover, the UK has already expressed concern about Facebook's transition to the financial sector. Currently, the social network is involved in a new investigation related to the analytical firm called Cambridge Analytica and data hacking of 50 million Facebook users. A possible fine could be $ 5 billion.

Finally, immediately after the launch, it became known that in order to purchase a coin, you need to register and specify your passport data there. The society was furious as it is definitely not the way of the decentralization and anonymity.
